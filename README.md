## 1. Data Description

This data pertains to direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The campaigns relied on phone calls to gauge client interest in subscribing to a bank term deposit product.  Multiple contacts with the same client were often necessary to determine their decision (subscribe or not subscribe).

## 2. Objective

- To conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of features and target variable

- To visualize the relationships between features(e.g., age, income, and loan amount) and the target variable using scatter plots, histograms, and box plots

- To handle outliers in the dataset.

## 3. Summary

The analysis highlights key factors influencing subscription rates, including client age, balance, contact duration, and loan status. Targeting middle-aged clients with higher balances and longer contact durations can enhance subscription rates. Focusing on clients without personal and housing loans, optimizing contact strategies, and leveraging past campaign successes are crucial. Tailoring marketing approaches based on education level, marital status, and job type will further improve targeting effectiveness. By implementing these insights and refining data handling practices, the bank can increase the efficiency of its marketing campaigns and boost overall subscription rates.
